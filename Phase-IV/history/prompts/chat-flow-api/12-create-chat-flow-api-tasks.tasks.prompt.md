# Create Chat Flow API Implementation Tasks

## Summary

Created comprehensive task list for the Chat Flow & API feature, organizing tasks by user story priority and following the checklist format with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities.

## Outcome

Generated complete task breakdown for the stateless chat API that enables users to interact with the AI-powered todo assistant, with 39+ specific tasks organized across 6 phases including setup, foundational, three user stories, and polish phases.

## Evaluation

The task list follows the required format with proper ID numbering, story labels, and file paths. Tasks are organized by user story priority to enable independent implementation and testing of each feature increment.
