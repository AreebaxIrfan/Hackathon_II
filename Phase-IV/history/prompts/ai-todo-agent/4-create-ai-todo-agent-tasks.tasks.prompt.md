# Create AI Todo Agent Implementation Tasks

## Summary

Created comprehensive task list for the AI Todo Agent feature implementation, organized by user story priority and following the checklist format with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities.

## Outcome

Generated complete task breakdown for the AI-powered todo assistant that interprets natural language and manages tasks through MCP tools, with 50+ specific tasks organized across 6 phases including setup, foundational, three user stories, and polish phases.

## Evaluation

The task list follows the required format with proper ID numbering, story labels, and file paths. Tasks are organized by user story priority to enable independent implementation and testing of each feature increment.
